This is a text-based fantasy game that is played by the user entering an input of a number (1,2,3 ect) depending on the options available to them. The text is displayed character-by-character, as if itâ€™s being written out, pausing slightly for full-stops. There is a combat system in the game, which puts you and your companion against (usually) two opponents (but can be more or fewer). The characters have an inventory and use the items within it in their fights. There is a save feature and there are three save slots which can be loaded when the game is launched, or deleted and re-written over.# FantasyGame
